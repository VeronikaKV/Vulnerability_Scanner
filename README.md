Vulnerability Scanner

Sorry for my bad english :)

The first step is to unload the vulnerability database from the archives. 
Unloading is carried out by the command:

Kali : mongorestore --host localhost --port 27017 --db DataCVE*  /<directory>/NVD.bson

The name of the base and collections must match the original one !!! 
Load archives into one database with the name ***DataCVE***!!

For more detailed information on working with the database, you can go to the site:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/ 

then you can run the script, you need to enter the IP of the scanned device and run the 
program, you will be provided with information from the collected databases about all the 
vulnerabilities and exploits found
